# WhatsAny-1
- A simple application that lets you WhatsApp people without saving their contact. (PS: It is a remake of my previous app)

- It can be accessed [here](https://shaikh-ubaid.github.io/WhatsAny-1/#/input-number)

# Salient Features:
- It is also a PWA and can be installed on your smartphone
- On installation, it feels just like a native application
- It also stores the numbers (and names if entered) in the form of cache in your browser.
